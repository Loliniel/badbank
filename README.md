## Bad Banking app for the Professional Certificate in Coding: For Women -November 2022 course

This project is an example of banking and ATM webapp.  It's using Node, Express, MongoDB.  Right now, I'm refactoring some of the code from earlier in the course and will update it over the next few weeks.

Current features include, deposits, withdrawals, and checking the balance.  Planned features include account creation, logging in and out, multiple account with transfers.
